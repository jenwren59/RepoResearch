## Week 2

This repository contains my peer assignments for the Coursera Data Science class of Reproducible Research. 
I have just submitted my first assignment. It is the first time I have created my own code that uses knitr in RStudio. 
I see that I have much to learn but this is a good start. The md file views well and I am able to see the HTML file well in my browser.

The analysis was interesting. I do not have time to fiddle more with the output since it is due today.
